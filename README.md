## About GoldenEye

Team GoldenEye is one of the participated groups in HACC 2017.

This is our project submission for the 2017 Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge (HACC)

Team GoldEye's goal is to create and implement several features that could benefit those who looking for 

the Hawaii Revised statutes provided by Hawaii State Legislature site.

## Inspiration

Looking for the statutes that will benefit your case but tired of clicking them one by one?

On official Hawai’i Government Website, https://portal.ehawaii.gov/government/hawaii-legislature/hawaii-revised-statutes/, Hawai’i Revised Statutes are opened to public for the good and justice.
However, despite its openness, the webpage only provides the directories to the contents but any searching methods. It is hard to go through the raw statues one by one can be irritating and wasting of time for some people.
If the statutes are clearly formatted and can be searched, displayed, and ordered with relevance, time saving and efficiency will be offered to the public.

## Features

* Using Laravel and PHP to let people can easily download and use it

* Store statues in mysql database and update when statues added or changed

* search mechanism based on the code numbers and words

* natural question processing

* ability to share the statutes through social media

* Have frequently asked legal question bar
